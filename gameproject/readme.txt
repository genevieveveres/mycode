Thank you for playing Spooky Scare Ghost Game! 

I know this code could be SO much more efficient than it is, and that there are probably bugs,
and this, and that, and so on and so forth.... but in my play testing I got to all 5 ending 
successfully, so I'm counting that as a win! I promise I spent more than a few hours on it. :)

This read-me is just going to have some info on my thought process about the game, so be warned:
here there be spoilers.

QUESTION: Why is some stuff really weird and vague at the start of the game?

ANSWER: Well dear read-me reader, my initial idea was for the player not to realize that they are the ghost 
in a kind of sixth-sense way. Nothing tells you that you are a ghost exactly, and the signs aren't 
overtly explained. You can go "up" and "down" when you phase through the floor, even though
those are hidden directions. Trying to go up further alludes to going to heaven, trying to go down
alludes to going somewhere else. You can't pick up certain items. You don't want to go beyond the 
property of the house. Et cetera. But I was trying not to make it overt until you perform the 
ritual and reinhabit your body. That may have ended up feeling inconsistent... oh well!

QUESTION: Why can I pick up the tome and the candles, but not the knife at first? 

ANSWER: The knife is not "of" you / not something that belonged to you before you died. You can pick up the 
candles and the tome because they are covered in dust / half melted / et cet, whereas the knife is
shiny and new and something the ghost hunters must have brought into the house with them after your
initial death. 

QUESTION: Why can I phase through the floor with the physical items I picked up?

ANSWER: Ghost powers. 

QUESTION: Why are I, as a half rotten corpse, strong enough to defeat three healthy human people, even armed?

ANSWER: Zombie powers.

QUESTION: Why didn't the ghost hunters have the equipment they needed to hunt you ready with them in their room?

ANSWER: Because they are silly.
